In computer science a bignum is an object representing an arbitrary precision
number, this is useful when you want to store a number bigger than SIZE_MAX without
any loss of precision. This is often achieved by storing an array or a string 
containing the different "parts" of the number.

Create a class called bigint that will store an arbitrary precision unsigned integer.

Your class must support addition, comparison and "digitshift" (like bitshift but instead 
of shifting the bits you will shift the digits in base 10, e.g. (42 << 3 == 42000) and 
(1337 >> 2 == 13)).
